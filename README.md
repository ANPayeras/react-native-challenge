# react-native-challenge

In this challenge I have made a image carrousel without libraries or plugins, to do that I have used Expo and Adroid Studio.

1 - First of all install Expo with te command -> npm install --global expo-cli.

2 - Then clone this repository, once this have done open the folder with some IDE, in my case I used Visual Studio Code.

3 - Once in VSC open the console and run -> npm start.

4 - Here a new tab in the browser will be opned, here there are some options to choose in this case I have used the Adroid Studio because I have not Mac to run a emulator for IOS.

5 - Now is necessary install Android Studio ('https://developer.android.com/studio'), and then create a virtual device. After that is necessary run de virtual device.

6 - Then in the tab that was be opened before we have to press on 'Run on Android device/emulator', this will be open the project in te virtual device.

For more detail see the video in the folder assets/react-native-challenge-app.mp4. In it I show how the app works, navigating between images with buttons, and storing the last position that we have seen, so when we restore the app shows that image.
